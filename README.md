Proposal: Job Board Notifier

1. **The Big Idea:** What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal? 
  - stretch goal: useful and sophisticated, bought by handshake and ccd.

2. **Learning Goals:**
	Given that our team has varied expectations and interests, this project idea is interesting to us all as we can accomplish all of our learning goals through this process. Below is a bulleted list of what we hope to achieve in the 8 weeks.
-       **Creating a Robotic Process Automation.** Understanding how it works and it’s implementations outside of this project.
-       **Web (HTML/XML) Scraping.** This is a skill we’ve heard in QTM 3 class that can be immensely useful for gathering a lot of data or information quickly and efficiently without exerting too much manual labor of going to various websites, scrolling for information, copying and pasting, etc.
-       **Email Automation.** This project will utilize automation in various forms, including emailing users. This is a transferable skill, like many of the other skills, and can have practical uses in our lives.
-       **Creating/Using or Integrating a Database in Python.** We will have to have a database integrated in Python to store our data and information. This is something new and will be an expansion on our intermediate/elementary Python skills.
-       **Creating an API.**

Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure
- Meeting using video calls & messaging over Slack
- Agile development, working independently but working together to troubleshoot issues & then integrate
- Split them up as tasks & then integrate it 
- We will be pair programming by showing each other the steps & understanding our issues and being able to fix them 


6. **Risks:**
This project when done correctly will be a huge success and has a practical use that can be really helpful for a lot of Babson students as they navigate the internship/job hunt process. Potential risk that we need to mitigate are:
-       Correctly writing and implementing the program exactly as we imagine it.
-       This project is creating a program that will be an intermediary between a user and multiple  job boards’ information. Thus:
-       We need to make sure that we aren’t breaking any potential rules of those job boards
-       Do the job boards open for public view or does one need to have an account in order to access it? If so, how do we go about getting information from them with the idea that multiple users will be using this application?
-       We need to correctly store the user and their preferences (keywords) as well as the post entries we have sent them. On that same note, are we going to have a line of code checking entries previously sent to see if there are duplicates of same posts being sent since this would be a compilation of jobs available from multiple job boards

7. **Additional Course Content:**
	All of our learning goals mentioned are core to our project and are topics we have not learned yet. These are contents that covered in class will be especially helpful for our project.
